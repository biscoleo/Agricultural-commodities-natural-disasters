# Exploratory Analysis and Pandas in Data Tools
This project was for a class called Data Tools, where we learned about webscraping, feature engineering, pandas, visualization, among other tools and techniques.

This project looked to do exploratory data analysis for agricultural commodities and natural disasters with the goal of eventually conducting a statistical analysis. It implemented techniques required for the class inlcuding webscraping, pkl files, exploratory data analysis techniques, pandas, and feature engineering.

Included is a paper that complements the project.
